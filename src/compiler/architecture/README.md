# Glistix Architecture

The compiler architecture inherited from the Gleam compiler is largely unchanged, more information of which can be found in the Gleam repository.

Therefore, this chapter intends to discuss a bit about the changes made in the Glistix code base on top of the base Gleam compiler. Those changes should be **the main focus of contribution** to the Glistix project.
