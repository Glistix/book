# Glistix v0.6.0 (Unreleased)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.6.3

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.6.3 ([#34](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/34) and [#35](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/35)).
    - Remarkably for Docker container users, this release brings a new `scratch` container without anything installed other than the Glistix compiler, which is useful for Nix target users.
    - In addition, this release brings variant inference in pattern matching, allowing one to access and update fields specific to each matched type variant in a `case` expression, as well as more LSP code actions such as to add missing type annotations to a function.
