# Glistix v0.4.0 (2024-09-07)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.4.1

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.4.1 ([#15](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/15) and [#19](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/19)).
    - This release adds label punning syntax (writing `function(data:)` instead of `function(data: data)`), adds support for the `<>` (string concatenation) operator in `const` variables' definitions, as well as several language server improvements (listing document symbols, completion for record fields on access, signature help when calling functions, and so on).
    - The JavaScript target also received support for endianness (`little` and `big`) and signedness (`signed` and `unsigned` integers) options on bit arrays, as well as sized float options (32-bit and 64-bit) and pattern matching on `utf8` bit arrays. These options are not yet supported on the Nix target (but will be on a future Glistix release).
    - The `gleam docs` (and thus the equivalent `glistix docs`) command received support for `--target`, allowing you to pick the target used to compile the project to retrieve docs for. This can be handy to generate Nix-specific docs with `glistix docs --target nix`.
