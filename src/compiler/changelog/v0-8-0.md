# Glistix v0.8.0 (Unreleased)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.8.1

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.8.1 ([#53](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/53)).
  - This release brings language server improvements, such as actions for renaming variables and generating function definitions, as well as the `gleam deps tree` command and bug fixes.
  - See the Gleam blog post for the full news: [https://gleam.run/news/gleam-gets-rename-variable/](https://gleam.run/news/gleam-gets-rename-variable/)

- Function doc comments are now generated in the resulting Nix code. ([#55](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/55))
  - The generated format is compatible with [Nix RFC 0145](https://www.github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/145).
  - As a consequence, starting with Nix 2.24, you can type `:doc glistix_function` in `nix repl` to view the doc comment for that function after importing it.
  - Note that any occurrences of `*/` in the doc comment are escaped as `* /` due to syntactical restrictions in the RFC's doc comment format.

- Glistix will now error at compile-time on invalid integer (signed 64-bit) or float (also 64 bits) literals on the Nix target. ([#54](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/54))
  - Previously, excessively large integers and floats would still be compiled to Nix, leading to syntactical errors later, which should have been compile-time errors.
