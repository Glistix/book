# Glistix v0.2.0 (Unreleased)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.2.1

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.2.1 ([#1](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/1) and [#3](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/3)).
    - This brings great improvements to the LSP, as well as many important bug fixes and improvements to diagnostics.
    - Target `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` was added to CI and to prebuilt release binaries.
- Ported some fixes for the JavaScript target from Gleam v1.2.0 to the Nix target as well ([#2](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/2)).
    - This fixes a miscompilation when using a module alias in a guard clause (see [gleam-lang/gleam#3045](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/pull/3045)).
