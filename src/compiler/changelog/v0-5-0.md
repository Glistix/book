# Glistix v0.5.0 (2024-12-23)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.5.1

- **You can now try Glistix in your browser!** Check out the Glistix online playground at [https://glistix.github.io/playground](https://glistix.github.io/playground)
  - The new playground supports **compiling Gleam to Nix** and **quickly sharing Gleam code compiled to Nix to the web**.
  - It only supports importing the Gleam standard library for now, at an older version (0.38), but there are plans to include more packages in the future, such as `glistix_nix`.
  - Huge thanks to the Gleam team for providing the base code for the playground!
  - **Read more at the dedicated book page,** which you can [find by clicking here](../../using-compiler/online-playground.md).

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.5.1 ([#26](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/26) and [#29](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/29)).
    - This release brings great improvements to diagnostics and to the LSP. For example, there is now support for completion of local variables and arguments in functions, as well as missing module imports and missing `case` clauses suggestions, which are all very welcome quality of life features.
    - In addition, you can now omit `:utf8` in BitArray segments, writing just `<<"Hello">>` instead of `<<"Hello":utf8>>`.
    - You can read more in the official Gleam blog post here: [https://gleam.run/news/convenient-code-actions/](https://gleam.run/news/convenient-code-actions/)

- Glistix now supports being compiled to WASM through the `compiler-wasm` crate ([#22](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/22)).
  - The Glistix web files are now distributed on every release with the `-browser` suffix.
  - This was essential to have [the playground](../../using-compiler/online-playground.md) work!

- Glistix now pins the Rust version it uses in its official flake through `fenix`, so you can compile Glistix from source using Nix more reliably ([#25](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/25)).
