# Glistix v0.3.0 (Unreleased)

- **Base Gleam version:** v1.3.2

- Updated Glistix to Gleam v1.3.2 ([#8](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/8), [#11](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/11) and [#12](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/12)).
    - This release improves LSP autocomplete, adds arithmetic operation support to case clause guards, adds version specifier support to `gleam add`, and brings several other improvements and bug fixes to the compiler.
    - A prebuilt Wasm binary, in order to use the compiler in the browser, has been added to releases.
- Ported some fixes for the JavaScript target from Gleam 1.3 to the Nix target as well ([#13](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/13)).
    - This fixes a miscompilation when using a record constructor alias in a constant (see [gleam-lang/gleam#3294](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/3294)).
    - A similar fix has been made to record constructor aliases in case clause guards as well (see [gleam-lang/gleam#3447](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/pull/3447)).
    - This also adds a compile-time error when trying to use a non-byte-aligned bit array on the Nix target (which currently only supports byte-aligned bit arrays).
    - Finally, this ensures `gleam.nix` (exported to the build folder and used to import the Nix prelude) isn't unnecessarily rewritten to avoid problems with watchers.
- Added Nix target support to language tests in the compiler ([#10](https://github.com/Glistix/glistix/pull/10)).
    - This change doesn't directly affect Glistix users, but adds some proper testing of Gleam's language features to the Nix target, improving the likelihood of bugs being caught in the Nix target implementation.
