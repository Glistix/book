# Introduction

**Welcome to Glistix!** [Glistix](https://github.com/glistix/glistix) is a **fork of the compiler for the Gleam language** which adds a **Nix backend,** so that you can **compile Gleam code into Nix** and **use it in your configurations!**

This allows you to leverage Gleam's **type-safety** and **simplicity** to write reasonable and more correct code. You will also be able to use **Gleam's tooling** in your favor, such as unit tests and easy package management.

If you'd like to **give Glistix a quick spin** before installing, make sure to check out [the Glistix playground](./using-compiler/online-playground.md).

If you **have a question or would like to contribute**, please **join our Zulip chat** with [this invite link](https://glistix.zulipchat.com/join/dj7k33san27nujoppkmuqalc/). The chat's history [can be accessed here](https://glistix.zulipchat.com/).

If you came to this page looking for more information on patching dependencies for Nix compatibility, check out ["Overriding incompatible packages"](./recipes/overriding-packages.md).

This book aims to explain many core concepts related to Glistix, possibly helping you use it more effectively for your projects.

Please note that this book is a work in progress! There's much more to come. You can contribute to the book either on [GitHub](https://github.com/glistix/book) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/glistix/book).
