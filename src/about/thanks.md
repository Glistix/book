# Thanks

- Thanks to [Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil) and the rest of [the Gleam team](https://github.com/gleam-lang) for their amazing work on the Gleam compiler and the Gleam ecosystem, which was fundamental for Glistix to come to exist.

- Thanks to the [Purenix project](https://github.com/purenix-org/purenix) for being one of our main inspirations. It has a lot of goals in common with the Glistix project, and generally demonstrated that the initial idea which led to Glistix could actually have been something viable to do.

- More generally, thanks to all contributors to Nix and the aforementioned projects as well.
