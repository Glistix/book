# Standard Library

The Gleam standard library can be used within Glistix through the **official Glistix `stdlib` port** at [https://github.com/Glistix/stdlib](https://github.com/Glistix/stdlib).

However, currently, it must be used as a **local dependency to a Git submodule.** See ["Overriding incompatible packages"](../../recipes/overriding-packages.md) for instructions.

In the specific case of the standard library, however, **this is already done automatically** by `glistix new`.
