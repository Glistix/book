# Nix bindings library

The Glistix project **maintains a library for fundamental bindings to Nix's built-in types and functions.** It is rather small at the moment, but might expand further in the future. It contains bindings for `Array` (built-in Nix lists), `AttrSet` and a few other types, as well as some built-in functions.

It is available on Hex, so, to use it, just run the command below:

```sh
glistix add glistix_nix
```

Check its documentation at [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/glistix_nix/).
